I'm excited to share my first end-to-end project on Amazon sales analysis! Here's an overview of the process:🌐💻

⛏⚒ Tools used:

1. *Python*: I used the Pandas library for data cleaning. This involved loading the raw sales data, handling missing values, transforming data types, and removing duplicates to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.

2. *SQL Workbench*: After cleaning the data with Python, I imported it into a SQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.

3. *Power BI*: I imported the data from SQL into Power BI and created visualizations to analyze Amazon sales trends and insights. This involved connecting Power BI to the SQL database, selecting the relevant tables, and designing interactive dashboards.
